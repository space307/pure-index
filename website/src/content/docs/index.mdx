Pure Index is a tool for packages. It helps to clean your packages of unused exports with ease.<br />
And it's also very fast ⚡️

## Motivation

We will use the `@my/ui-kit` package as an example.

```ts title="ui-kit/src/index.ts"
export { Button } from './components/button';
export { Text } from './components/text';

export { ThemeProvider, useTheme, type Theme } from './themes';
...
```

The number of exports increases over time. All of its exportable code requires support. But is all of it actually being used?

You can check this manually by just looping through the exports. It's time consuming and there is a chance of error. What if it's code is used by multiple repositories?

Let's automate this process!

## Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh [npm]
    npm install -D pure-index
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh [yarn]
    yarn add -D pure-index
  ```
  </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh [pnpm]
    pnpm add -D pure-index
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
  ```sh [bun]
    bun add -D pure-index
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Quick Start

Pure Index can be used either through a [command line interface](/pure-index/intro/cli) with an optional [configuration file](/pure-index/reference/configuration), or else through its [JavaScript API](/pure-index/intro/js-api).

1. Add the `check-exports` script in the `package.json` of each package that needs to be checked

```diff
    "scripts": {
+     "check-exports": "pure-index"
    }
```

2. Run

```sh
npm run check-exports
```

3. Depending on the project, you may need to [configure](/pure-index/reference/configuration) Pure Index.
