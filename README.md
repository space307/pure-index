# ðŸŒ¿ Pure Index

Pure Index is utility for packages. It helps to find all unused exports or collect used imports of a package. For any local repository.

## Motivation

We will use the `ui-kit` package as an example. Its _index.ts_ file looks like this

```ts
export { Button } from './components/button';
export { Text } from './components/text';

export { ThemeProvider, useTheme, type Theme } from './themes';
...
```

All of its exportable code requires support. But is all of it actually being used?

You can check this manually by just looping through the exports. It's time consuming and there is a chance of error. What if it's code is used by multiple repositories?

We need to automate this process!

## First step

```sh
npm install --save-dev pure-index
```
